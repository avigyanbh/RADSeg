# Messaging Service
Messaging service is an abstraction created to facilitate mapping server communication. Whether the mapping server wants to broadcast/send map chunks/updates or whether a human wants to query the mapping server.

This abstraction is very volatile and its in its infancy and hence not fully
documented.

## Available Options:
- ros: Utilizes ROS2 as the communication fabric.
